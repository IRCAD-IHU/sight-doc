General

Introduction
------------

The framework FW4SPL (FrameWork for Software Production) is an open-source 
framework, developed by IRCAD (research institute against cancer and disease). 
The principle of FW4SPL is the fast and easy creation of applications, mainly 
in the medical field. Therefore it provides features like digital image
processing in 2D and 3D, visualization or simulation of medical interactions. 
To build an application with FW4SPL there are no programming skills required. 
By writing a simple XML the user can design its own application.
 
FW4SPL is built on a component-based architecture composed of C++ libraries. 
The three main concepts of the architecture, explained in the following sections, are:

-  object-service concept
-  component approach
-  signal-slot communication

The framework is multi-platform and runs under Windows, Linux and MacOS. 
The programming language of the framework is C++.
This document will introduce the general architecture of FW4SPL.
