Overview
--------

"Signals and slots" is a language construct introduced in `Qt <http://wiki.qt.io/Qt_signal-slot_quick_start>`_. for
communication between objects.  The concept is that
objects and services(explained in 2.3) can send signals containing event information which can be
received by other services using special functions known as slots.


FW4SPL implementation
---------------------

In the FW4SPL architecture, the library ``fwCom`` provides a set of tools
dedicated to communication. These communications are based on the signal and
slot concept.

``fwCom`` provides the following features :

-  function and method wrapping
-  direct slot calling
-  asynchronous slot calling
-  ability to work with multiple threads
-  auto-disconnection of slot and signals
-  arguments loss between slots and signals

Slots
-----

Slots are wrappers for functions and class methods that can be attached
to a ``fwThread::Worker``. The purpose of this class is to provide
synchronous and asynchronous mechanisms for method and function calling.

Slots have a common base class : SlotBase. This allows to store them in
the same container. Slots are designed to allow calling them by knowing
only the argument types.

Examples :

A slot wrapping the function sum, which is a function with
the signature int (int, int) :

.. code:: c++

    ::fwCom::Slot< int (int, int) >::sptr slotSum = ::fwCom::newSlot( &sum );

A slot wrapping the function start with signature void() of
the object ``a`` which class type is ``A`` :

.. code:: c++

    ::fwCom::Slot< void() >::sptr slotStart = ::fwCom::newSlot(&A::start, &a);

Execution of the slots using the run method :

.. code:: c++

    slotSum->run(40,2);
    slotStart->run();

Execution of the slots using the method call, which returns the result
of the execution :

.. code:: c++

    int result = slotSum->call(40,2);
    slotStart->call();

A slot declaration and execution, through a SlotBase :

.. code:: c++

    ::fwCom::Slot< size_t (std::string) > slotLen
            = ::fwCom::Slot< size_t (std::string) >::New( &len );
    ::fwCom::SlotBase::sptr slotBaseLen = slotLen;
    ::fwCom::SlotBase::sptr slotBaseSum = slotSum;
    slotBaseSum->run(40,2);
    slotBaseSum->run<int, int>(40,2);

    // This one needs the  explicit argument type
    slotBaseLen->run<std::string>("R2D2");
    result = slotBaseSum->call<int>(40,2);
    result = slotBaseSum->call<int, int, int>(40,2);
    result = slotBaseLen->call<size_t, std::string>("R2D2");

Signals
-------

Signals allow to perform grouped calls on slots. For this purpose, a signal
class provides a mechanism to connect slots.

Examples:

The following instruction declares a signal with a signature of type void.

.. code:: c++

    ::fwCom::Signal< void() >::sptr sig = ::fwCom::Signal< void() >::New();

The connection between a signal and a slot of the same information type :

.. code:: c++

    sig->connect(slotStart);

The following instruction will trigger the execution of all
slots connected to this signal :

.. code:: c++

    sig->emit();

It is possible to connect multiple slots having the same information type to
the same signal and trigger simultaneously their execution.

Signals can take several arguments as signature and trigger their connected slots
by passing the right arguments.

In the following example a signal is declared of type void(int, int). The signal is connected
to two slots of different type void (int) and int (int, int).

.. code:: c++

    using namespace fwCom;
    Signal< void(int, int) >::sptr sig2 = Signal< void(int, int) >::New();
    Slot< int(int, int) >::sptr    slot1 = Slot< int(int, int) >::New(...);
    Slot< void(int) >::sptr        slot2 = Slot< void(int) >::New(...);

    sig2->connect(slot1);
    sig2->connect(slot2);

    sig2->emit(21, 42);

Here 2 points need to be highlighted :

-  A signal cannot return a value. In consequence of that fact their return type is declared to void. 
   Thus, the return value of a slot, triggered by a signal, cannot retrieved neither.
   
-  To trigger successfully a slot by a signal, the minimum requirements as number of arguments or 
   fitting argument types has to be given by the signal. In the last example the slot slot2 only 
   requires one argument of type int, but the signal is emitting two arguments of type int. 
   Hence the signal signature fulfilles the slot's argument number and argument type, the signal 
   can successfully trigger the slot slot2. The slot slot2 is taking the first emitted argument which 
   fits its parameter (here 21, the second argument is ignored).


Disconnection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The method disconnect is called between one signal and one slot, to stops their existing connection. 
A disconnecting assumes a signal slot connection. Once a signal slot connection is disconnected, the slot 
cannot be triggered by this signal. Connection as well as disconnection of a signal slot connection can be 
done at any time.

.. code:: c++

    sig2->disconnect(slot1);
    sig2->emit(21, 42); // do not trigger slot1 anymore

The instructions above will cause the execution of slot2. Due to the disconnection between sig2 and slot1, 
the slot slot1 is not triggered by sig2.

Connection handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The connection between a slot and a signal returns a connection handler :

.. code:: c++

    ::fwCom::Connection connection = signal->connect(slot);

Each connection handler provides a mechanism which allows to disable a
signal slot connection temporarily. The slot stays connected to the signal, but it will
not be triggered while the connection is blocked :

.. code:: c++

    ::fwCom::Connection::Blocker lock(connection);
    signal->emit();
    // 'slot' will not be executed while 'lock' is alive or until lock is
    // reset

Connection handlers can also be used to disconnect a slot and a signal
:

.. code:: c++

    connection.disconnect();
    // slot is not connected anymore

Auto-disconnection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Slots and signals can handle an automatic disconnection :

-  on slot destruction : every signal slot connection to this slot will be destroyed
   
-  on signal destruction : every slot connection to the signal will be destroyed

All related connection handlers will be invalidated when an automatic
disconnection occurs.

Manage slots or signals in a class
----------------------------------

The library ``fwCom`` provides two helper classes to manage signals or slots in
a structure.

HasSlots
~~~~~~~~

The class ``HasSlots`` proposes a mapping between a key (string defining the slot name)
and a slot. ``HasSlots`` allows to manage many slots due to a map. To use
this helper in a class, the class must inherit from ``HasSlots`` and it must register the slots
in the constructor:

.. code:: c++

    struct ThisClassHasSlots : public HasSlots
    {
      typedef Slot< int()> GetValueSlotType;

      ThisClassHasSlots()
      {
          GetValueSlotType::sptr slotGetValue
                = ::fwCom::newSlot( &SlotsTestHasSlots::getValue, this );
          HasSlots::m_slots("sum", &SlotsTestHasSlots::sum, this)
                           ("getValue", slotGetValue );
      }

      int sum(int a, int b)
      {
          return a+b;
      }

      int getValue()
      {
          return 4;
      }
    };

Then, slots can be used as below :

.. code:: c++

    ThisClassHasSlots obj;
    obj.slot("sum")->call<int>(5,9);
    obj.slot< ThisClassHasSlots::GetValueSlotType >("getValue")->call();

HasSignals
~~~~~~~~~~

The class ``HasSignals`` provides a mapping between a key (string defining the signal name) and a signal.
``HasSignals`` allows to manage many signals due to a map, comparing to ``HasSlots``. To use this helper in a class, the class must inherit from
``HasSignals`` as seen below and it must register signals in the constructor:

.. code:: c++

    struct ThisClassHasSignals : public HasSignals
    {
      typedef ::fwCom::Signal< void()> SignalType;

      ThisClassHasSignals()
      {
          SignalType::sptr signal = SignalType::New();
          HasSignals::m_signals("sig", signal);
      }
    };

Then, signals can be used as below:

.. code:: c++

    ThisClassHasSignals obj;
    Slot< void()>::sptr slot = ::fwCom::newSlot(&anyFunction)
    obj.signal("sig")->connect( slot );
    obj.signal< SignalsTestHasSignals::SignalType >("sig")->emit();
    obj.signal("sig")->disconnect( slot );

Signals and slots used in objects and services
-------------------------------------------------------

Slots are used in both objects and services, whereas signals are only integrated in services. The abstract
class ``fwData::Object`` inherits from ``HasSignals`` class as basis to use signals :

.. code:: c++

    class Object : public ::fwCom::HasSignals
    {
      /// Key in m_signals map of signal m_sigObjectModified
      static const ::fwCom::Signals::SignalKeyType s_OBJECT_MODIFIED_SIG;

      /// Type of signal m_sigObjectModified
      typedef ::fwCom::Signal< void ( CSPTR( ::fwServices::ObjectMsg ) ) >
                    ObjectModifiedSignalType;

      /// Signal that emits an ObjectMsg when an object is modified
      ObjectModifiedSignalType::sptr m_sigObjectModified;

      Object()
      {
          m_sigObjectModified = ObjectModifiedSignalType::New();
          m_signals( s_OBJECT_MODIFIED_SIG,  m_sigObjectModified);
      }
    }

And the abstract class ``fwService::IService`` inherits from the ``HasSlots`` class and the ``HasSignals`` class, as basis to communicate through signals and slots:

.. code:: c++

    class IService : public ::fwCom::HasSlots, public ::fwCom::HasSignals 
    {
      /// Key in m_slots map of slot m_slotReceive
      static const ::fwCom::Slots::SlotKeyType s_RECEIVE_SLOT;

      /// Type of signal m_slotReceive
      typedef ::fwCom::Slot<void(ObjectMsg::csptr)> ReceiveSlotType;

      /// Slot to call receive method
      ReceiveSlotType::sptr m_slotReceive;

      IService()
      {
          m_slotReceive  = ::fwCom::newSlot( &IService::receive   , this ) ;
          ::fwCom::HasSlots::m_slots( s_RECEIVE_SLOT , m_slotReceive )
      }
    }

Accordingly to the design, the ``s_OBJECT_MODIFIED_SIG``
object signal is connected to all ``s_RECEIVE_SLOT`` slots of their associated services (object service relation).
When a service modifies its associated object, the service emits a ``s_OBJECT_MODIFIED_SIG``
signal of the object in order to notify any service working on the modified
object through the receive method.

An other way to communicate between objects and services is
to split each modification type in different signals and to
create different slots in the services. In this case, the method
``IService::getObjSrvConnections()`` and the helper
``::fwServices::helper::SigSlotConnection`` provides few tools to
connect/disconnect signals/slots between objects/services.


Proxy
-----

The class ``::fwServices::registry::Proxy`` is a communication element and singleton in the architecture. 
It defines a proxy for
signal/slot connections. The proxy concept is used to declare
communication channels : all signals registered in a proxy's channel are
connected to all slots registered in the same channel. This concept is
useful to create multiple connections or when the slots/signals are not created yet (possible in dynamic programs).

The following shows an example to connect one signal to several slots:

.. code:: c++

    const std::string CHANNEL = "myChannel";

    ::fwServices::registry::Proxy::sptr proxy
        = ::fwServices::registry::Proxy::getDefault();

    ::fwCom::Signal< void() >::sptr sig = ::fwCom::Signal< void() >::New();

    ::fwCom::Slot< void() >::sptr slot1 = ::fwCom::newSlot( &myFunc1 );
    ::fwCom::Slot< void() >::sptr slot2 = ::fwCom::newSlot( &myFunc2 );
    ::fwCom::Slot< void() >::sptr slot3 = ::fwCom::newSlot( &myFunc3 );

    proxy->connect(CHANNEL, sig);

    proxy->connect(CHANNEL, slot1);
    proxy->connect(CHANNEL, slot2);
    proxy->connect(CHANNEL, slot3);

    sig->emit(); // All slots are called

Object messages
------------------------

The communication system called *communication channel system* which was used in the former versions of FW4SPL, was replaced by the signal slot communication system.
In consequence of the communication system replacing, object messages were introduced. So on each object modification, a message is send to inform
services that an object modification happened.
The signals and slots use a message parameter to store information of the object modification or
specialize the message from others. The library ``fwComEd`` contains all message
structures which can be used to communicate object modifications. As shown in the table below,
several messages are available for each object.
