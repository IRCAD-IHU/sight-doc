Terminology :
==============

- Rules are mandatory. Any rule can be (exceptionally) exceeded, but if so, it has to be rigorously justified.
- Recommendations are optional.
- ==Camel case== is the practice of writing compound words or phrases such that each word or abbreviation begins with a capital letter. In programming languages, ==camel case== is assumed to start with a lowercase letter. We will use the term ==upper camel case== when it starts with a capital.
