# Goal and general information

_Brief description of the goal of this research._

# Specification

_Specifications include functional, performance, language and data. The algorithms should focus on solving a specific problem with well-defined interfaces._

# Background

_Background check to see what algorithms exist for solving the problem. Do they meet our needs? Have better new algorithms been published?_

# Data

_Collection of data required for testing (or training in the case of learning-based algorithms). Formatting of data so that it can be inputted to the algorithm._

# Evaluation

_Evaluation framework is used to test the algorithm for correctness and meeting performance specification._

# Baseline

_Baseline selection, implementation and evaluation._

# Prototyping

_The main algorithm research cycle: evaluate performance, make improvements, repeat._

# Integration

_Integration of algorithm code into production system._

# Documentation

_Document how the algorithm works (internal and/or article publication)._
