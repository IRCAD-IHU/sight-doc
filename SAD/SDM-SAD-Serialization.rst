Overview
--------

Serialization is the process to save plain C++ structures from memory to hard
drive.  In fw4spl, ``fwAtoms`` library provides tools to serialize all data (and
especially Object than extend ``::fwData::Object``) to a JSON format [#]_.  Of
course, this process is also available for loading data from JSON format to
plain C++ structures.

.. [#] Introducing JSON. http://json.org/


To realize this serialization, ``fwAtoms`` provides basic structures (which extend
``::fwAtoms::Base``) to manage better plain C++ structure evolution. Thus, there
are two main steps in the serialization process:

- How to convert a ``::fwData::Object`` into a ``::fwAtoms::Object``
- How to serialize a ``::fwAtoms::Base`` in a JSON format

Atom objects
------------

The basic structures provided by ``fwAtoms`` library are a set of restricted C++
type. All these structures extend ``::fwAtoms::Base`` and cover all basic types
and containers:

.. csv-table::
    :header: "type","brief"
    :widths: 1,3

    ::fwAtoms::Base,"Base class of all atoms"
    ::fwAtoms::String,"Atom to represent string types"
    ::fwAtoms::Numeric,"Atom to represent numeric types (floating number or integer)"
    ::fwAtoms::Boolean,"Atom to represent a boolean value"
    ::fwAtoms::Map,"Atom to represent an associative container (std::string to ::fwAtoms::Base)"
    ::fwAtoms::Sequence,"Atom to represent a sequence of object like vector or list"
    ::fwAtoms::Object,"Atom to represent a C++ object with attributes"
    ::fwAtoms::Blob,"Atom to represent binary information like buffers"

For instance, consider the following C++ class :

.. code:: cpp

    class SimpleClass
    {
        bool m_myBoolean;
    };

    class ComplexClass
    {
        std::string m_myString;
        float m_myFloat;
        SimpleClass* m_mySimpleClass;
    };

It's Atom equivalent is (simplified code) :

.. code:: cpp

    fwAtoms::Object
    {
        metaInfos
        {
            "CLASSNAME_METAINFO" : "SimpleClass"
            "ID_METAINFO" : "<ID of the object>"
        }

        attributes
        {
            "myBoolean" : ::fwAtoms::Boolean
        }
    }


    fwAtoms::Object
    {
        metaInfos
        {
            "CLASSNAME_METAINFO" : "ComplexClass"
            "ID_METAINFO" ; "<ID of the object>"
        }

        attributes
        {
            "myString" : ::fwAtoms::String
            "myFloat" : ::fwAtoms::Numeric
            "mySimpleClass" : ::fwAtoms::Object("SimpleClass")
        }
    }


The main advantage of this representation is the ability to change easily the
form of a class.  In fact, all plain C++ objects are represented as
``Atoms::Object`` with a map of attributes.  Thus, adding, removing or changing
the content of an attribute is easy.  Moreover, because of these restricted
types, atom parsing is also made easier.  The main difficulty is how to convert
plain C++ object using this set of restricted types.

Convert a ``fwData::Object``
----------------------------

As explained earlier, all objects in fw4spl inherit from ``::fwData::Object``
class.  To convert a C++ object in Atom, it must inherit from this class.  To
allow this conversion, some work must be done.

The first things is to update the header file of the structure and add these lines :

.. code:: cpp

    // Before all namespace
    fwCampAutoDeclareDataMacro((<namespace elem>)
            (<namespace elem>)(<class name>), <method export macro>);

    // In the public class part
    fwCampMakeFriendDataMacro((<namespace elem>)
            (<namespace elem>)(<class name>));


These two functions allow declaring the class to the conversion process.

Next, the conversion system have to know the class information such as
attributes, base class, library location and data version. This is achieved by
creating a class which defines these properties.

Example
~~~~~~~

To illustrate this, we can take the previous class and create this two files:


Header file of the newly created class : ComplexClass.hpp

.. code:: cpp

    // Reference class

    fwCampAutoDeclareDataMacro((fwData)(ComplexClass), FWDATA_API);

    namespace fwData
    {
    class ComplexClass : public ::fwData::Object
    {
        fwCampMakeFriendDataMacro((fwData)(ComplexClass));

        std::string m_myString;
        float m_myFloat;
        ::fwData::SimpleClass* m_mySimpleClass;
    };
    }


Header file of serialization class :

.. code:: cpp

    // hpp binding file
    #include <fwCamp/macros.hpp>
    #include <fwData/ComplexClass.hpp>
    #include "fwDataCamp/config.hpp"

    fwCampDeclareAccessor((fwData)(ComplexClass), (fwData)(SimpleClass));


Source file of serialization class :

.. code:: cpp

    // cpp binding file
    // include previous cpp file

    #include <fwCamp/UserObject.hpp>

    fwCampImplementDataMacro((fwData)(ComplexClass))
    {
        builder
            .tag("object_version", "1")
            .tag("lib_name", "fwData")
            .base< ::fwData::Object>()
            .property("myString" , &::fwData::ComplexClass::m_myString)
            .property("myFloat" , &::fwData::ComplexClass::m_myFloat)
            .property("mySimpleClass" , &::fwData::ComplexClass::m_mySimpleClass)
            ;
    }

In header file, the method fwCampDeclareAccessor is necessary when an object
have a pointer or a smart pointer to an other object.

In source file, fwCampImplementDataMacro declare the properties of the bound
object with an object called a builder : it provides several methods to
describe the object to bind.

.. csv-table::
    :header: "method","brief"
    :widths: 1,3

    "tag(key, value)","Register a tag in the atom meta information."
    "base<BaseClass>()","Identify the base class of the bound object"
    "property(arg1, arg2)","Set property of the object and how to access it"

Most of the work is completed when header file of class has been updated and
binding class created.  The last step to complete is to register the binding
class in the conversion system using the following line in the library
containing binding classes :

.. code:: cpp

    localDeclarefwDataComplexClass();

In fw4spl, data are located in ``fwData`` library whereas data binding classes are
located in ``fwDataCamp`` library. The above line registering a binding class can
be found in ``fwDataCamp`` autoload.hpp files.


Serialization file example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For more information about serialization see:

.. csv-table::
    :header: "location", "brief"

    "Srclib/core/fwData/include/","fwData header files with serialization macros"
    "Srclib/core/fwDataCamp","Serialization description of all fw4spl data"
    "Srclib/core/fwDataCamp/include/fwDataCamp/autoload.hpp","Auto loading data bindings in the system"


``fwData::Object`` to ``fwAtoms::Object`` conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The necessary to convert a ``fwData::Object`` to a ``fwAtoms::Object`` is in
``fwAtomConversion`` library.

To make this conversion, use this two functions:

.. code:: cpp

     //Convert a fwData::Object into fwAtoms::Object
     SPTR(::fwAtoms::Object) convert( const SPTR(::fwData::Object) &data );

     //Convert a fwAtoms::Object into fwData::Object
     SPTR(::fwData::Object) convert( const SPTR(::fwAtoms::Object) &atom );


Serialize an Atoms object to JSON format
----------------------------------------

When fw4spl data are converted into Atoms, the can be saved in JSON format. An
Atom reader as well as an Atom writer are available in ``fwAtomsBoostIO``
fw4spl library: simply instantiate one of these classes with an Atom object
and call read or write method.

To serialize atoms into json, a visitor pattern is used. An example can be
found in the ``fwAtomsBoostIO/Reader.cpp`` file.


Conclusion
----------

With this, you have now the necessary to serialize a data in the framework and
a basic knowledge about the mechanism behind. To finish, this is a diagram of
the serialization mechanism:
